# LambdaTest Hackathon Project

This project demonstrates the use of Selenium WebDriver with TestNG for automated testing, integrated with LambdaTest's cloud-based Selenium Grid. Below are the key features and tools used:

## Features
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **TestNG**: For test execution and reporting.
- **Extent Reports**: For generating interactive HTML test reports.
- **LambdaTest Integration**: For running tests on a cloud-based Selenium Grid with cross-browser and cross-platform support.
- **ConfigReader Utility**: For managing sensitive credentials and configurations via a `application.properties` file.

## Highlights
- Tests include login functionality and JavaScript alert handling.
- Credentials and configurations are securely managed using a `application.properties` file.
- Extent Reports provide detailed and interactive test execution reports.
- LambdaTest capabilities are configured for remote execution.

This is my QA Hackathon submission. I hope you all like it! If you need any assistance, feel free to contact me at kinivinayak07@gmail.com.
